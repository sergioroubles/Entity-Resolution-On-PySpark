# Entity-Resolution-On-PySpark

This repository contains an integral development of an Entity Resolution algorithm on PySpark.

The problem of duplicate detection in large databases is a vital process that appears in diverse and both academical and industry enviroments, its formal study being known as Entity Resolution. All throughout this project, framed in a research in collaboration with the Oftalmology department of the Hospital Cl√≠nico de Madrid, we will tackle the problem that involves the presence of numberous duplicates in a pacient database. To this aim, the problem will be thouroughly discussed, the theoretical underlying mathematical theory will be developped, and a particular solution to the problem will be presented and studied with the help of Spark. The analysis of the results will yield to several conclusions concerning the optimal strategies to face the duplicate detection problem in structured databases.
